Supplication to Milarepa
by Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche

dakpé tsa kham lha yi chakgyar min
Your pure channels and elements ripened as the mudrā of the deity;
soktsol zhomdral dorjé na dé sung
Your speech, through prāṇāyāma, is the indestructible nāda;
dechen lhenkyé ga zhi nyöpé tuk
And your mind, through the experience of the four joys, is co-emergent bliss.
jetsün zhepa dorjér solwa deb
Lordly Shepa Dorje, I supplicate you.

sipar zhenlok chö gyé ching lé drol
Having given up addiction toward existence, let me be freed from the shackles of the eight worldly
concerns.
mögü tsé jin lama sangye tong
With perfect respect, may I receive your blessings and see the guru as a buddha;
wenpar tsechik drubpé naljor gyi
And, with single-pointed accomplishment of yoga in isolated places,
ku zhi tsensa tsé dir zinpar dzö
May I seize the throne of the four kāyas in but a single lifetime.

namzhik tsé pö gön khyö gyepé zhing
When my time comes, may I be born in your joyful buddha-field, my protector –
rangnang ngönpar gawé tsal kyé té
The natural manifestation of the pleasant realm, Manifest Joy.
drel tok khakhyab yichen gyatso kün
Then, having awakened there, may I lead all the infinite beings
naljor wangchuk gopang gö nü shok
With whom I have a connection to the state of the mighty yogin.

This arose out of the ocean-like faith of the childlike Maṅgala, who cherishes the liberated
life of the great and glorious adept as a jewel within his heart.
